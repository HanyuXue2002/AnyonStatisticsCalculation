This is a program to calculate general statistics of Abelian invertible topological excitations, in the research region of condensed matter physics and quantum field theory. 

In the first version of our program, the input data is a simplicial complex, a finite fusion group(containing types of topological excitations at different dimensions together with fusion rules). The program will calculate the general statistics and how to realize it by moving operators in Hilbert space.

When the fusion group is $G$, the dimension of topological excitation is $d$ and choosing the simplicial complex as a $n$ dimensional simplex, then you will get the result $H^{n+2}(K(G,n-d),U(1))$. You can do more interesting calculation by using more complicated simplicial complex. However, the time and memory cost increase dramatically!
